Task tracker system
We need to develop simple console task tracker system.
#Part 1
The system should have following capabilities:
1. Create, show and delete users, projects and tasks
2. Assign user on the project
3. Assign task on the user
4. Generate the report of all tasks created for specified Projects by specified User
Application should use embedded or innemory database (e.g. SQLite, H2).
Initial data should be loaded to the database from files when application is starting. It might be csv, tsv,
json, xml or any file type convenient for you.
Pay attention: it is not necessary to save any new data to files. They are used only for initial loading to
the system.
#Part 2 (optional)
Now we want to have the ability to create subtasks for tasks:
1. Each task may have any number of subtasks
2. Each subtask may have any number of subtasks
3. When some task/subtask is closing, all it's subtasks should be closed too
4. Task should have the ability get sum of remaining time include all subtasks
Common recommendations:
- In case all parts werenâ€™t completed it is still possible to send the task for check
- Keep it simple. It is strong not recommended to develop any features not specified in
requirements.
- Build tools is very useful. Do not hesitate use one of them.
- Do not upload sources to the public repos. Please upload it to google disk and send link
Task should be implemented in 1 week since it was provided. Exceptions are possible but we should
be notified in timely manner.
